## Rockets are cool

This repo connects programming with rocket science. The goal of the project is to build a feature complete rocket simulator, that can capture telemetry data for AI training, simulate rocket concepts and even SpaceX styled landings!

## Contribution

I'm still learning physics, so all error corrections are appreciated. Also feel free to contribute to the physics simulator aswell.
